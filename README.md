Hi!
My name is Kenny! ;D I'm 15, almost 16!
I have always been obsessed with electronics, and computers in general. They are the black magic that runs this modern 21st Century world.

6:
I first began circuits when I was 6; I can remember staying behind during my breaktimes just to mess with a battery, a switch, and a filament bulb. Whenever I heard that we were soon going to learn about circuits for a period of the school year, I was always excited.

I also enjoyed spending my lunchtimes at computer clubs for my age - my earliest experience of using a laptop (tiny!) and a mouse.

7+:
When I was 7, I programmed "BeeBots" which were, programmable toy bees with six or so buttons. In class, we'd use a 2D plastic floor map on which we had to program the BeeBot to follow a certain route. Then, to have more advanced learning, we made our own maps.
At that age, I also learnt how to use MS Word & PowerPoint for the first time! And also how to copy and paste! I would make PowerPoints for my aunt and my family.

9+:
I have been coding since I was 9, beginning with Tynker and then Scratch.
I made games with "Tynker", and gained knowledge of how blocks work & function through trial & error, and also through looking at example programs. With "Scratch", I built even more advnaced programs - with less lag!
I also recieved a very nice gift from my aunties and uncle - "Snap Cirtcuts Light". It was the best gift ever! I tinkered so much with it, and thoroughly enjoyed working through the 175+ projects in the book.

12 - 13:
At the age of 12, I began learning HTML - poorly! I placed all my CSS code in the style tags! Oh dear!
And 12-13 I made a few of the messiest websites you could dream of! (It's the thought that counts!)
I copied and pasted lots of JavaScript - without a clue in the world what any line of code meant! Haha!
I have always enjoyed the simplicity of HTML - and CSS espescially!
At 13, I joined the computer science club at my secondary school, and found out about the micro:bit - a progammable microcontroller with multple sensors, and outputs. I was instantly consumed by it! I made a birthday card for my brother the next month - which he adored.

14:
I began learning Python, beginning with the impression that HTML was the most superior 'programming' language. (I didn't know what markup languages were then)
However, it grew on me. Quickly.
Writing lines of multi-coloured code was very gratifying!
I also learnt it is a language that is in high demand, and is very popular and useful.
In may, my secondary school had an activities week where we choosed what to do. The option I picked was a computer science week where we learned about hacking, did the CyberSpace tournament, learnt about network security, and had a quiz - which my team won! Everyone recieved a credit card RFID blocker, but my team recieved a £5 Amazon gift card each. We then went to play laser tag at Planet Laser, which is where I got an RGB LED light bulb keychain.
15:
During Covid-19 lockdown, I began learning Ruby - basically Python but better??? I have yet to complete the SoloLearn course.
I also made an extremely professional, minimal, and colourful dynamic website, which I am chuffed to have made - with only the smallest chunk of copied code ever - the navbar! I was, and am still, extremely proud of it!
I also learnt SQL at school.
A few days ago, from when I'm writing this body of text, I extracted multiple components from cheap electronics for my micro:bit.
For example:
  - A vibration motor from a cheap fitness-tracker that my aunt was given for free, and gave to my brother for Xmas 2019
  - A 3mm red LED, push button, and piezo buzzer from a golden poop toy that made the creepiest sounds of laughter and flashed the red LED to them
  - A switch button and 5mm RGB LED with IC from the light bulb keychain from the Planet Laser trip
  - A motor from a Science Museum Uk "Brush Robot" that I got at the age of 8/9
  - I also kept 4 100Ω ±5 resistors from a physics lesson about resistance in series & parralel circuits

16:
I am hoping to get a Raspberry Pi/Arduino, and sensors kit, for my birthday - but it seems my parents think I want an iPhone 12?!
